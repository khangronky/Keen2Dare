Help me brainstorm a creative and engaging concept for a web-based 2D game that educates players about climate action and sustainability in Vietnam or Australia. 

Make the web-based game both fun and meaningful to play in a browser.

The theme focuses on climate action and sustainability policy choices.

Key objectives:
+ The game should make players experience the trade-offs between environmental, social, and economic decisions.
+ It should be humorous and slightly satirical (like the “Reigns” mobile game) so players can laugh at the dilemmas of being a leader trying to balance progress and sustainability.
+ Each decision should have clear consequences shown in stats or visuals (e.g., Environment, Economy, People, Energy).
+ The player should feel the tension between doing what’s good for the planet and what’s politically or economically easy.

Gameplay mechanics:
+ Each turn, the player receives a policy proposal card (e.g., “Ban plastic bags?”, “Build a new coal power plant?”, “Invest in solar farms?”).
+ They can swipe or click “Approve” or “Reject”.
+ Each decision affects four stats: Environment, Economy, People’s Support, and Energy Supply.
+ If any of these stats reach 0 or 100, the government collapses, ending the game.
+ Random events can appear (floods, protests, power shortages, etc.) to challenge the player’s balance.
