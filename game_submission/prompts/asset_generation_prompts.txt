The game is inspired by the Reigns-style decision mechanic, where the player acts as a “Minister of Climate Affairs.” 
Each turn, the player swipes or clicks to “Approve” or “Reject” environmental policies. Every decision affects four main indicators: 
- Environment
- Economy
- People
- Energy

The art style should be minimalist, modern, and easy to integrate into a web browser using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Visual Style:
- Vibrant but balanced color palette (greens, blues, oranges, purples).
- Simple iconography that conveys meaning instantly.
- A professional yet playful aesthetic that reflects both education and humor.
