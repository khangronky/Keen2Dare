# Preigns 🌍⚖️

> A browser-based decision-making game about climate policy and sustainability

---

## 📖 Overview

**Preigns** is a 2D, browser-based decision-making game inspired by the _Reigns_ series. You play as the **Minister of Climate Affairs**, making tough choices to balance four critical metrics: Environment, Economy, People's Support, and Energy Supply.

The game aims to raise awareness about **climate action and sustainability challenges** in Vietnam and Australia through an experience that is fun, educational, and slightly satirical.

## 🎮 Game Summary

In each round, you're presented with a **policy card** featuring proposals like:

- "Ban plastic bags?"
- "Invest in solar energy?"
- "Subsidize coal power?"

You can **Approve** ✅ or **Reject** ❌ the proposal — each decision affects your four stats:

| Stat                 | Icon | Description                        |
| -------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Environment**      | 🌿   | Health of ecosystems and climate   |
| **Economy**          | 💰   | Financial stability and growth     |
| **People's Support** | ❤️   | Public approval and trust          |
| **Energy Supply**    | ⚡   | Power availability and reliability |

### Game Over Conditions

If any stat reaches **0** or **100**, your term ends and the game is over.
