                    <h2>Your Role as President</h2>
                    <p>
                        You have been elected as the President of your nation. The weight of an entire country rests upon your shoulders.
                        Every decision you make will ripple through the fabric of society, affecting the economy, environment, public opinion,
                        and national security. Your term is a constant balancing act‚Äîone wrong move could plunge the nation into chaos,
                        while strategic decisions could usher in a golden age of prosperity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As President, you will face proposals from your cabinet of advisors‚Äîeach representing different sectors of government.
                        The Minister of Transportation, Treasury Secretary, Environmental Minister, Defense Chief, and many others will
                        present you with critical decisions that demand immediate action. You must decide: approve or reject. Left or right.
                        Yes or no. The fate of millions hangs in the balance.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Preigns</strong> is inspired by the acclaimed "Reigns" game series, where you govern through
                        simple yet consequential swipe-based choices. Each proposal appears as a card that you can:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="instruction-list">
                        <li><strong>Swipe RIGHT (or press ‚Üí)</strong> to APPROVE the proposal</li>
                        <li><strong>Swipe LEFT (or press ‚Üê)</strong> to REJECT the proposal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        While the mechanic is simple, the consequences are profound. Every choice affects four critical pillars of your nation:

                        <p>
                            The economy represents your nation's financial health and prosperity. A strong economy means thriving businesses,
                            employed citizens, and a robust treasury. However, aggressive economic growth can come at the cost of environmental
                            degradation or public welfare.
                        </p>

                            <li><strong>Balanced Economy (25-75%):</strong> Stable growth with sustainable development</li>
                            <li><strong>Low Economy (0-25%):</strong> Recession, unemployment, and potential economic collapse</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            Environmental health measures your nation's commitment to sustainability and ecological preservation. In an age of
                            climate crisis, ignoring the environment leads to disaster, but over-regulation can stifle economic growth.

                        <p>
                            Public support reflects how much your citizens trust and approve of your leadership. Without the people's backing,
                            you cannot govern effectively. But pandering to popular opinion may lead to unsustainable policies.

                            National security encompasses defense, law enforcement, cybersecurity, and emergency preparedness. A secure nation
                            protects its citizens from threats, but excessive militarization can drain resources and erode civil liberties.

                    <h2>The Balancing Act: Why Extremes Are Dangerous</h2>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Any pillar reaching <strong>0%</strong> or <strong>100%</strong> results in
                        <strong>GAME OVER</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This may seem counterintuitive‚Äîwhy would 100% economy or 100% security be bad? The answer lies in the nature of governance:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="instruction-list">
                        <li><strong>100% Economy:</strong> Unchecked capitalism leads to corporate tyranny and extreme inequality</li>
                        <li><strong>0% Economy:</strong> Total economic collapse and societal breakdown</li>
                        <li><strong>100% Environment:</strong> Over-regulation strangles all industry, leading to unemployment</li>
                        <li><strong>0% Environment:</strong> Ecological catastrophe makes the land uninhabitable</li>
                        <li><strong>100% Public Support:</strong> Populist policies become unsustainable, leading to backlash</li>
                        <li><strong>0% Public Support:</strong> Revolution and removal from power</li>
                        <li><strong>100% Security:</strong> Authoritarian police state with no freedom</li>
                        <li><strong>0% Security:</strong> Anarchy and lawlessness consume the nation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Your goal is to keep all four pillars <strong>balanced between 1-99%</strong>. This requires strategic thinking,
                        careful planning, and sometimes making unpopular but necessary decisions.

                            of 12 monthly decisions (proposals). How many years can you survive? Can you maintain power for decades, or will
                            your presidency crumble within the first term?

                    <ul class="instruction-list">
                        <li><strong>Watch the bars constantly:</strong> Keep an eye on all four pillars‚Äîdon't focus on just one</li>
                        <li><strong>Think ahead:</strong> If economy is at 80%, avoid approving pro-business proposals that push it higher</li>
                        <li><strong>Balance opposing forces:</strong> Economy and environment often conflict; support and security may clash</li>
                        <li><strong>Remember impacts:</strong> As you swipe, the impact preview shows what each choice will do</li>
                        <li><strong>Don't panic:</strong> One extreme choice won't ruin you‚Äîit's the cumulative effect that matters</li>
                        <li><strong>Accept trade-offs:</strong> Sometimes you must sacrifice one pillar to save another</li>
                        <li><strong>Learn from failure:</strong> Each game over teaches you about cause and effect in governance</li>

                    <h2>Understanding Your Advisors</h2>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the game, proposals come from various government officials and advisors. Each advisor represents a specific
                        sector with their own priorities:
                    </p>
                    <ul class="instruction-list">
                        <li><strong>Treasury Secretary & Commerce Minister:</strong> Focus on economic growth and business</li>
                        <li><strong>Environmental Minister & Conservation Director:</strong> Prioritize ecological health</li>
                        <li><strong>Health Minister & Education Secretary:</strong> Care about public welfare and support</li>
                        <li><strong>Defense Minister & Intelligence Director:</strong> Emphasize national security</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Understanding each advisor's perspective helps you predict the consequences of your decisions. A proposal from the
                        Defense Minister will likely boost security but may reduce public support or economic resources.

                        <strong>Preigns</strong> is more than a game‚Äîit's a reflection on the complexity of governance.
                        Real-world leaders face impossible choices daily, balancing competing interests and managing limited resources.
                        No decision is purely good or evil; every choice has consequences.

                        Through this game, you'll experience the pressure of power, the weight of responsibility, and the challenge of
                        maintaining equilibrium in a dynamic, unpredictable world. Will you be a cautious centrist, a bold reformer,
                        or a pragmatic survivor? The choice is yours, Mr./Madam President.
