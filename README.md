Overview

Climate Reigns is a 2D, browser-based decision-making game inspired by the Reigns series. You play as the Minister of Climate Affairs, making tough choices to balance Environment, Economy, People’s Support, and Energy Supply.

The game aims to raise awareness about climate action and sustainability challenges in Vietnam and Australia through an experience that is fun, educational, and slightly satirical.

Game Summary

In each round, you’re presented with a policy card (e.g., “Ban plastic bags?”, “Invest in solar energy?”, “Subsidize coal power?”). You can Approve or Reject the proposal — each decision changes your four stats:

⚡ Energy Supply

If any stat reaches 0 or 100, your term ends and the game is over. Your goal: Survive as many years as possible while keeping your country in balance.
